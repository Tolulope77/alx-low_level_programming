0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
libmy.a - Create the static library libmy.a
main.h - Header file containing the prototypes of all functions included in
libholberton.a.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
create_static_lib.sh - Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current 
directory
